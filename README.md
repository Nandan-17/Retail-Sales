Status: Active Jupyter Notebook  
Visit the project notebook for full analysis: [Notebook Link]  

An analytical study of retail transactions from an online store. The project uses a dataset of thousands of invoices containing product details, customer information, and sales records. The analysis provides insights into sales performance, customer purchasing patterns, and potential strategies to improve profitability.

# 🌟 Overview
This project explores how sales are distributed across products, customers, and countries in a retail environment.  
The dataset includes transactional details such as invoice numbers, product codes, descriptions, quantities, unit prices, and customer demographics.  

The notebook walks through the process of:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Visualization of sales and customer behavior  
- Insights into revenue distribution and high-performing products  

The goal is to understand retail sales trends and provide a foundation for future predictive models in business analytics.

# ✨ Key Features
- Comprehensive dataset of over 500,000 retail transactions  
- Analysis of sales performance based on:  
  - Country and region  
  - Product categories and codes  
  - Customer segmentation  
  - Seasonal and time-based sales patterns  
- Visualizations showing top-selling products, customer distribution, and revenue trends  
- Business-oriented structure that can be extended to machine learning tasks like customer segmentation and sales forecasting
